## Mark Features 
- Minimal and Quick
- Supports commonmark standards
- built to be to the point and add no overhead for people who simple enjoy writing in markdown 

## Motivation 
I write a lot, which you can read on [reaper.is](https://reaper.is) and this tool was primary 
built to act as a quick markdown app that I could access from anywhere.
